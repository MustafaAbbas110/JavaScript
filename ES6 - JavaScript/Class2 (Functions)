//Arrow functions
//ES6 introduces a new kind of function called the arrow function. Arrow functions are very similar to regular functions in behavior, but are quite different syntactically. The following code takes a list of names and converts each one to uppercase using a regular function:

const upperizedNames = ['Farrin', 'Kagure', 'Asser'].map(function(name) { 
  return name.toUpperCase();
});
//The code below does the same thing except instead of passing a regular function to the map() method, it passes an arrow function. Notice the arrow in the arrow function ( => ) in the code below:

const upperizedNames = ['Farrin', 'Kagure', 'Asser'].map(
  name => name.toUpperCase()
);

/*
With the function above, there are only a few steps for converting the existing "normal" function into an arrow function.
remove the function keyword
remove the parentheses
remove the opening and closing curly braces
remove the return keyword
remove the semicolon
add an arrow ( => ) between the parameter list and the function body
*/

const names = ['Afghanistan', 'Aruba', 'Bahamas', 'Chile', 'Fiji', 'Gabon', 'Luxembourg', 'Nepal', 'Singapore', 'Uganda', 'Zimbabwe'];
const longNames = names.filter( name => name.length > 6 );

//Regular functions can be either function declarations or function expressions,
//however arrow functions are always expressions. In fact, their full name is "arrow function expressions",
//so they can only be used where an expression is valid. This includes being:

/*
1. stored in a variable,
2. passed as an argument to a function,
3.and stored in an object's property.
*/
//One confusing syntax is when an arrow function is stored in a variable.
const greet = name => `Hello ${name}!`;
//In the code above, the arrow function is stored in the greet variable and you'd call it like this:
greet('Abbas');
//Returns: Hello Abbas!

// empty parameter list requires parentheses
const sayHi = () => console.log('Hello Udacity Student!');
sayHi();

// multiple parameter list requires parentheses
const sayHi = (a,b) => console.log(`Hello Udacity Student! ${a}, ${b}`);
sayHi(1,2);

//Concise and block body syntax
//All of the arrow functions we've been looking at have only had a single expression as the function body:

const upperizedNames = ['Farrin', 'Kagure', 'Asser'].map(
  name => name.toUpperCase()
);
//This format of the function body is called the "concise body syntax". The concise syntax:
//1. has no curly braces surrounding the function body
//2. and automatically returns the expression.
//If you need more than just a single line of code in your arrow function's body,
//then you can use the "block body syntax".

const upperizedNames = ['Farrin', 'Kagure', 'Asser'].map( name => {
  name = name.toUpperCase();
  return `${name} has ${name.length} characters in their name`;
});

//Important things to keep in mind with the block syntax:
//it uses curly braces to wrap the function body
//and a return statement needs to be used to actually return something from the function.

const myFunction = function() {
  //...
}

to

const myFunction = () => {
  //...
}
=================================================================================
//This Fuctions

//With regular functions, the value of this is set based on how the function is called. With arrow functions,
//the value of this is based on the function's surrounding context.
//In other words, the value of this inside an arrow function is the same as the value of this outside the function.
//Let's check out an example with this in regular functions and then look at how arrow functions will work.

// constructor
function IceCream() {
  this.scoops = 0;
}

// adds scoop to ice cream
IceCream.prototype.addScoop = function() {
  setTimeout(function() {
    this.scoops++;
    console.log('scoop added!');
  }, 500);
};

const dessert = new IceCream();
dessert.addScoop();
//Prints:
//scoop added!

//After running the code above, you'd think that dessert.scoops would be 1 after half a millisecond.
//But, unfortunately, it's not:

console.log(dessert.scoops);
//Prints:
//0

//Can you tell why?
//The function passed to setTimeout() is called without new, without call(), without apply(),
//and without a context object. That means the value of this inside the function is the global object and NOT the dessert object.
//So what actually happened was that a new scoops variable was created
//(with a default value of undefined) and was then incremented (undefined + 1 results in NaN):

console.log(scoops);
//Prints:
//NaN

//One way around this is to use closure:

// constructor
function IceCream() {
  this.scoops = 0;
}

// adds scoop to ice cream
IceCream.prototype.addScoop = function() {
  const cone = this; // sets `this` to the `cone` variable
  setTimeout(function() {
    cone.scoops++; // references the `cone` variable
    console.log('scoop added!');
  }, 0.5);
};

const dessert = new IceCream();
dessert.addScoop();
//The code above will work because instead of using this inside the function,
//it sets the cone variable to this and then looks up the cone variable when the function is called.
//This works because it's using the value of the this outside the function.
//So if we check the number of scoops in our dessert right now, we'll see the correct value of 1:

console.log(dessert.scoops);
//Prints:
//1

//Well that's exactly what arrow functions do, so let's replace the function passed to setTimeout() with an arrow function:

// constructor
function IceCream() {
  this.scoops = 0;
}

// adds scoop to ice cream
IceCream.prototype.addScoop = function() {
  setTimeout(() => { // an arrow function is passed to setTimeout
    this.scoops++;
    console.log('scoop added!');
  }, 0.5);
};

const dessert = new IceCream();
dessert.addScoop();
//Since arrow functions inherit their this value from the surrounding context, this code works!

console.log(dessert.scoops);
//Prints:
//1

//When addScoop() is called, the value of this inside addScoop() refers to dessert.
//Since an arrow function is passed to setTimeout(),
//it's using its surrounding context to determine what this refers to inside itself.
//So since this outside of the arrow function refers to dessert,
//the value of this inside the arrow function will also refer to dessert.
//Now what do you think would happen if we changed the addScoop() method to an arrow function?

// constructor
function IceCream() {
    this.scoops = 0;
}

// adds scoop to ice cream
IceCream.prototype.addScoop = () => { // addScoop is now an arrow function
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.scoops++;
    console.log('scoop added!');
  }, 0.5);
};

const dessert = new IceCream();
dessert.addScoop();
//Yeah, this doesn't work for the same reason - arrow functions inherit their this value from their surrounding context.
//Outside of the addScoop() method, the value of this is the global object.
//So if addScoop() is an arrow function, the value of this inside addScoop()
//is the global object. Which then makes the value of this in the function passed to setTimeout() also set to the global object!'

=================================================================================
//Default function parameters
//Default function parameters are quite easy to read since they're placed in the function's parameter list:

function greet(name = 'Student', greeting = 'Welcome') {
  return `${greeting} ${name}!`;
}

greet(); // Welcome Student!
greet('James'); // Welcome James!
greet('Richard', 'Howdy'); // Howdy Richard!

//Defaults and destructuring arrays
//You can combine default function parameters with destructuring to create some pretty powerful functions!
function createGrid([width = 5, height = 5]) {
  return `Generates a ${width} x ${height} grid`;
}
createGrid([]); // Generates a 5 x 5 grid
createGrid([2]); // Generates a 2 x 5 grid
createGrid([2, 3]); // Generates a 2 x 3 grid
createGrid([undefined, 3]); // Generates a 5 x 3 grid
createGrid() // Throw an Error!
//Solution
function createGrid([width = 5, height = 5] = []) {
  return `Generates a ${width} x ${height} grid`;
}
createGrid(); // Generates a 5 x 5 grid


//Defaults and destructuring objects
//Just like array destructuring with array defaults, a function can have an object be a default parameter and use object destructuring:
function createSundae({scoops = 1, toppings = ['Hot Fudge']}) {
  const scoopText = scoops === 1 ? 'scoop' : 'scoops';
  return `Your sundae has ${scoops} ${scoopText} with ${toppings.join(' and ')} toppings.`;
}
createSundae({}); // Your sundae has 1 scoop with Hot Fudge toppings.
createSundae({scoops: 2}); // Your sundae has 2 scoops with Hot Fudge toppings.
createSundae({scoops: 2, toppings: ['Sprinkles']}); // Your sundae has 2 scoops with Sprinkles toppings.
createSundae({toppings: ['Cookie Dough']}); // Your sundae has 1 scoop with Cookie Dough toppings.
createSundae(); //error
//solution
function createSundae({scoops = 1, toppings = ['Hot Fudge']} = {}) {
  const scoopText = scoops === 1 ? 'scoop' : 'scoops';
  return `Your sundae has ${scoops} ${scoopText} with ${toppings.join(' and ')} toppings.`;
}

//Array defaults vs. object defaults
*/
Default function parameters are a simple addition, but it makes our lives so much easier!
One benefit of object defaults over array defaults is how they handle skipped options. Check this out:
*/
//function createSundae({scoops = 1, toppings = ['Hot Fudge']} = {}) { … }
//...with the createSundae() function using object defaults with destructuring,
//if you want to use the default value for scoops but change the toppings,
//then all you need to do is pass in an object with toppings:
createSundae({toppings: ['Hot Fudge', 'Sprinkles', 'Caramel']});

//Compare the above example with the same function that uses array defaults with destructuring.
function createSundae([scoops = 1, toppings = ['Hot Fudge']] = []) { … }
/*
With this function setup, if you want to use the default number of scoops but change the toppings,
you'd have to call your function a little...oddly:
*/createSundae([undefined, ['Hot Fudge', 'Sprinkles', 'Caramel']]);
//Since arrays are positionally based,
//we have to pass undefined to "skip" over the first argument (and accept the default) to get to the second argument.
//Unless you've got a strong reason to use array defaults with array destructuring,
//we recommend going with object defaults with object destructuring!

function buildHouse({floors = 1, color = 'red', walls = 'brick'} = {}){
    return `Your house has ${floors} floor(s) with ${color} ${walls} walls.`
}
console.log(buildHouse()); // Your house has 1 floor(s) with red brick walls.
console.log(buildHouse({})); // Your house has 1 floor(s) with red brick walls.
console.log(buildHouse({floors: 3, color: 'yellow'})); // Your house has 3 floor(s) with yellow brick walls.
